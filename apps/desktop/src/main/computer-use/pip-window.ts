 * Picture-in-picture mirror of the window Computer Use is driving.

 * The agent cursor can only be seen when the target window is. During ordinary
 * background work it is not: the user is looking at something else and the
 * driven window is underneath it. Codex answers this with
 * `CUAServiceRemoteHostedPIPController` — a live mirror of the backgrounded
 * app, with the agent cursor drawn into it — under a setting worded "Show
 * backgrounded apps that Computer Use is working on in Picture-in-Picture
 * mode." That is the real fix for occlusion: stop competing for the user's
 * screen and give the work its own small window.
 *
 * Codex streams via ScreenCaptureKit across XPC. Maka does not need either.
 * Every mutating action already returns a fresh screenshot of the target
 * (captured after the settle wait, so it shows the settled result), and that
 * frame is already in hand by the time the action completes. Mirroring it costs
 * nothing beyond the window. The trade is that this is a flipbook of
 * post-action frames rather than continuous video — enough to see what the
