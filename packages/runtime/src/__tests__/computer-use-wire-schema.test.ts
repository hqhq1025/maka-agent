// What the model is allowed to send has to match what the tool knows how to do.
//
// There are two schemas. `computerWireParams` is what the SDK validates a tool
// call against; `computerParams` is the strict union the tool narrows it to.
// Only the first one is enforced against a model, and only the second one has
// ever been tested.
//
// `window_action` shipped through that gap. Its fields went into the union, its
// tests passed against the union, and a real-machine probe called the backend
// directly and moved a window 80 points without taking the foreground. The wire
// schema is `.strict()` and had no `window_action`, `position` or `size`, so
// every call a model made was rejected by the SDK before reaching the tool —
// and invisibly, because the debug journal wraps `impl`, which was never
// reached. On a real run the model found the right action, was rejected,
// concluded "let me use that with the proper field names", and ran out of turn.
//
// This test exists so the next action cannot ship the same way.
